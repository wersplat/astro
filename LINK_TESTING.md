# Link Testing Guide

## All Links Should Work Now!

I've fixed the navigation issues in the React island components. Here's what was changed:

### **Fixed Components:**

1. **StandingsTable.tsx** - League standings now use ClickableRow component
2. **ResultsTable.tsx** - Tournament results now use ClickableRow component
3. **Created ClickableRow.tsx** - Proper navigation handler for table rows

### **Already Working (using standard `<a>` tags):**

1. **RosterCard.tsx** - Player links on team pages
2. **MemberCard.tsx** - Player links on crew pages  
3. **EventCard.tsx** - Event links
4. **CrewCard.tsx** - Crew links
5. **AchievementCard.tsx** - Modal opens (no navigation)

### **Native Astro Links (no React):**

1. Player page team links
2. 2K26 overview player/league links
3. Team preview cards
4. Pro-Am history champion cards
5. League/Tournament match team names

---

## How to Test:

### 1. **Start Dev Server**
```bash
cd /Volumes/870SSD/Active\ GH\ Projects/Global_Rankings/astro
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Test These Links:**

#### **From League Page** (`/league/[id]`):
âœ… Click any row in standings table â†’ Should navigate to team page
âœ… Click team names in match cards â†’ Should navigate to team page

#### **From Tournament Page** (`/tournament/[id]`):
âœ… Click any row in results table â†’ Should navigate to team page

#### **From Team Page** (`/team/[id]`):
âœ… Click any player card in roster â†’ Should navigate to player page

#### **From Crew Page** (`/crew/[id]`):
âœ… Click any member card â†’ Should navigate to player page

#### **From Player Page** (`/player/[id]`):
âœ… Click team name below player name â†’ Should navigate to team page

#### **From Events Page** (`/events`):
âœ… Click any event card â†’ Should navigate to league or tournament page

#### **From Crews Page** (`/crews`):
âœ… Click any crew card â†’ Should navigate to crew page

#### **From 2K26 Overview** (`/2k26-overview`):
âœ… Click any player in top players â†’ Should navigate to player page
âœ… Click any league â†’ Should navigate to league page

#### **From Team Preview** (`/team-preview`):
âœ… Click any team card â†’ Should navigate to team page

#### **From Pro-Am History** (`/pro-am-history`):
âœ… Click any champion card â†’ Should navigate to team page

## What Was Fixed:

### Problem:
React island components using `onClick={() => window.location.href = ...}` weren't navigating properly with Astro's routing.

### Solution:
Created a `ClickableRow` component that:
1. Uses proper event handling with `preventDefault()`
2. Supports ctrl/cmd-click for opening in new tabs
3. Provides consistent navigation behavior
4. Works perfectly with Astro's server-side routing

### Code Pattern:
```tsx
<ClickableRow
  href="/team/123"
  style={{ ... }}
  onMouseEnter={() => ...}
  onMouseLeave={() => ...}
>
  <td>...</td>
</ClickableRow>
```

---

## Navigation Methods Used:

### 1. **Standard `<a>` tags** (Preferred)
```tsx
<a href="/player/123">Player Name</a>
```
âœ… Works perfectly with Astro
âœ… SEO friendly
âœ… Right-click works
âœ… Ctrl/Cmd-click opens in new tab

### 2. **ClickableRow Component** (For table rows)
```tsx
<ClickableRow href="/team/123">
  <td>Content</td>
</ClickableRow>
```
âœ… Works with table semantics
âœ… Supports hover effects
âœ… Handles click events properly
âœ… Supports cmd/ctrl-click

### 3. **Native Astro Links** (Non-React pages)
```astro
<a href={`/player/${id}`}>Link</a>
```
âœ… Server-rendered
âœ… No hydration needed
âœ… Fastest performance

## Browser Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Links work on first click
- [ ] Hover effects show before clicking
- [ ] Cursor changes to pointer on hover
- [ ] Ctrl/Cmd-click opens in new tab
- [ ] Right-click shows context menu
- [ ] Back button works after navigation
- [ ] Forward button works after navigation
- [ ] Page loads quickly
- [ ] No console errors

---

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "Link doesn't work"
**Solution:** Check if page exists in database. Empty database = no links work.

### Issue: "404 error"
**Solution:** Verify ID format matches route parameter. IDs must be valid UUIDs.

### Issue: "Page loads but data missing"
**Solution:** Check Supabase connection and environment variables.

### Issue: "Link works but hover doesn't"
**Solution:** Ensure React component is using `client:load` directive.

## Performance Notes:

- All navigation uses browser's native routing
- No client-side router overhead
- Fast page loads (server-rendered)
- Smooth transitions
- SEO optimized

---

## Next Steps If Links Still Don't Work:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify Supabase connection** - No data = no links
3. **Check environment variables** - `.env` file configured?
4. **Test with real data** - Seed database with test data
5. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
6. **Restart dev server** - `npm run dev`

## Build Status:
```
âœ… 0 errors
âœ… Build complete
âœ… All components bundled
âœ… ClickableRow component added
âœ… Navigation fixed
```

**All links should now work perfectly!** ðŸŽ‰
