# ✅ Navigation Menu Fixed

## Problem
Dropdown menus were closing when trying to move mouse from button to menu items due to gap between elements.

## Solution
Added an **invisible bridge** element between the button and dropdown menu to maintain hover state.

## How It Works

### Before (Broken)
```
[Button]
  ↓ 4px gap ← Mouse leaves container here!
[Dropdown] ← onMouseLeave triggers, dropdown closes
```

### After (Fixed)
```
[Button]
  ↓ Invisible 8px bridge ← Mouse stays in container
[Dropdown] ← Hover maintained, dropdown stays open
```

## Technical Implementation

```tsx
{/* Invisible bridge */}
<div style={{
  position: 'absolute',
  top: '100%',
  left: 0,
  width: '100%',
  height: '8px',
  display: exploreOpen ? 'block' : 'none'
}} />

{/* Dropdown menu */}
<div style={{
  position: 'absolute',
  top: 'calc(100% + 8px)',
  ...
}} />
```

The invisible bridge element:
- Extends from the bottom of the button
- Fills the gap space (8px)
- Only visible when dropdown is open
- Keeps mouse within the parent container
- Prevents `onMouseLeave` from triggering
