# ✅ Final Fixes Applied

## Team Page - Opponent Links Added

### Issue: Team names weren't linked in match cards

### Solution: Added "vs Opponent →" clickable link
```tsx
<a href={`/team/${oppTeamId}`}>
  vs Opponent →
</a>
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Click to view opponent team page
- ✅ Hover changes color to blue
- ✅ Stops event propagation (doesn't trigger card expand)
- ✅ Shows on every match card

## League Stats Fixed

### Match Count
**Before:** Showed only recent 10 matches
**After:** Shows total season matches

```typescript
const { data: allMatches } = await supabase
  .from('matches')
  .select('*')
  .eq('season_id', id);

const totalMatches = allMatches?.length || 0; // Accurate count!
```

### Team Count
**Before:** Might have been incorrect
**After:** Shows unique teams from team_rosters

```typescript
const teams = Array.from(uniqueTeams.values());
// Displays: {teams.length} in stat tile
```

const { data: playerStatsRaw } = await supabase
  .from('player_stats')
  .select('player_id, points, assists, rebounds, players!inner(...)')
  .in('match_id', allMatches.map(m => m.id));

// Aggregate by player
const playerStatsMap = new Map();
playerStatsRaw.forEach(stat => {
  if (!playerStatsMap.has(stat.player_id)) {
    playerStatsMap.set(stat.player_id, {
      player_id: stat.player_id,
      gamertag: stat.players.gamertag,
      team_name: stat.players.teams.name,
      points: 0,
      assists: 0,
      rebounds: 0,
      games: 0
    });
  }
  
  const playerData = playerStatsMap.get(stat.player_id);
  playerData.points += stat.points;
  playerData.assists += stat.assists;
  playerData.rebounds += stat.rebounds;
  playerData.games += 1;
});

// Sort by PPG
const playerStats = Array.from(playerStatsMap.values())
  .sort((a, b) => (b.points / b.games) - (a.points / a.games))
  .slice(0, 20);
```
