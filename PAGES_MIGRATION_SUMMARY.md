- `team-preview/` - General team preview components
- `pro-am-history/` - Pro-Am history timeline and stats
- `upa-college/` - UPA College components

### Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Next.js Dependencies**
   - Removed `'use client'` directives where not needed
   - Removed `import { cookies } from 'next/headers'`
   - Removed `import Link from 'next/link'` and converted to `<a>` tags
   - Removed `useRouter` and `useSearchParams` from Next.js navigation
   - Removed `export const dynamic` statements

2. **Adapted to Astro**
   - Server-side data fetching moved to page frontmatter
   - Used `Astro.params` for dynamic route parameters
   - Used `Astro.url.searchParams.get()` for query parameters
   - Used `Astro.cookies` for Supabase authentication
   - Replaced `createClientServer(() => cookieStore)` with `createClientServer(Astro.cookies)`
   - Replaced `createClientServer` with `createClientBrowser` in client components

3. **Replaced MUI in Astro Pages**
   - Removed MUI component imports from `.astro` files
   - Used inline styles for layout in page files
   - Kept MUI components in `.tsx` React components (rendered with `client:load`)

4. **Navigation Updates**
   - Added "Ranking System" to Explore menu
   - Added "2K26 Overview" and "Team Preview" to Competition menu
   - All new pages are accessible via navigation

### Page Structure

All pages follow this structure:
```astro
---
// Import statements
import Layout from '@/layouts/Layout.astro';
import Component from '@/components/...';

// Data fetching (for dynamic routes)
const { id } = Astro.params;
const supabase = createClientServer(Astro.cookies);
// ... fetch data

// Query params (for list pages)
const searchParams = {
  search: Astro.url.searchParams.get('search') || undefined,
  // ... other params
};
---

<Layout title="Page Title">
  <div style="...">
    <!-- Page content with React components using client:load -->
    <Component prop={data} client:load />
  </div>
</Layout>
```

### Components Structure

- Client components (`.tsx` with `'use client'`) handle interactivity
- Server data fetching happens in page frontmatter
- Components receive data as props
- Navigation uses `window.location.href` instead of Next.js router

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test all page routes load correctly
2. Verify search params work on filtered pages
3. Test dynamic routes with actual IDs
4. Verify Supabase data fetching works in Astro context
5. Check that client-side components hydrate properly
6. Test navigation between pages
7. Verify responsive layouts work correctly

## Known Limitations

1. Some advanced features from Next.js server components may need client-side refactoring
2. The submit-results page is a placeholder and needs full implementation
3. Some stat calculations may need to be moved to API endpoints or computed on the client
4. Image optimization from Next.js Image component is not available (using regular img tags)

## Next Steps

1. Test each page thoroughly
2. Add missing API endpoints if needed
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add loading states for client components
5. Optimize data fetching strategies
6. Consider adding ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for static pages
